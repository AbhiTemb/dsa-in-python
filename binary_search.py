# applying binary search in problem

''' 
Step 1 : State the problem clearly 
State the problem clearly in abstract terms
We need to find out the given number in a decreasing order sorted list of numbers.
This is to be done in minimum number of operations or lookups
'''

def locate_card(cards, query):
    pass

'''
Step 2: Come up with example inputs and outputs
Try to cover all edge cases
cards = [5,4,3,2,1]
query = 2
output = 3

We will write our test cases in form of dictionaries

'''
result = locate_card([1,2], 1)
print(result)
output = 8
print(result == output )
